# compromise.playerpiano

A sequencer to automate parsing text using the NLP module, Compromise.

The Player Pianos of old would mechanically pull through a sheet of perforations
to operate a piano and play a song. Compromise.pianoplayer does the same. But
instead it runs through a sequence of user-provided commands to 'play' through the
natural language processor, Compromise, to manipulate sentences to find patterns
and perform tagging. The end result is like some gigantic function, created by
the user to manipulate and transform tagging on documents.
